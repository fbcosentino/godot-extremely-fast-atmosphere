name="Extremely Fast Atmosphere"
description="A (spherical) planet atmosphere system for Godot which doesn't use any form of ray marching and has no heavy math all. instead it has as much information baked into textures (curves and colors) as possible, which also makes it extremely customisable. Performance is on the same order of magnitude as StandardMaterial3D.
